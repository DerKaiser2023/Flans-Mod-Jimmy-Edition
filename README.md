# Flans Mod Jimmy Edition

a decompiled modified version of Flans Mod LabJac Edition (fork of flans mod) that just adds unreasonable shit like weapon overheating, "advanced" vehicle repair system, a fucking tech tree (because labjac is dumb) along with whatever random shit i thought.

this is eating me from the inside.

# why is it called Jimmy Edition?

jimmy escaped the cage and corrupted it. we have no way of keeping him in his cage. jimmy is fucking insane and is driving my budget out just to keep his ass in the cage.

# why tf is this not in the basic file structure for mc mods

i fucking decompiled this shit. im too fucking lazy to set that shit up until i finish developing this flaming garbage pile of regrets and dissapointment.

# feel free to donate money to keep me from going insane.
why because im fucking broke as shit rn.

# how do i download this?
why tf do you want to download this garbage. i havent even finished programming the shit i want.

# did you a-
no, and frankly, labjac can fuck off. im already looking at the kar98k because i have to FIX PEOPLES FUCKING MISTAKES.

# can i contribute?
i dont fucking care.
