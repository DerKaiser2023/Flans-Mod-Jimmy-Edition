# Flans Mod Jimmy Edition

a decompiled modified version of Flans Mod LabJac Edition (fork of flans mod) that just adds unreasonable shit like weapon overheating, "advanced" vehicle repair system, a fucking tech tree (because labjac is dumb) along with whatever random shit i thought.

this is eating me from the inside.

# why is it called Jimmy Edition?

jimmy escaped the cage and corrupted it. we have no way of keeping him in his cage.

# why tf is this not in the basic file structure for mc mods

i fucking decompiled this shit. im too fucking lazy to set that shit up until i finish developing this flaming garbage pile of regrets and dissapointment.

#feel free to donate money to keep me from going insane.
why

im fucking broke as shit rn.
